const planning = "The planning phase involves project and product management tasks such as resource allocation, capacity planning, scheduling, cost estimation, and provisioning. It includes gathering input from stakeholders to define software requirements, determining necessary resources and costs, and clarifying expectations. Deliverables from this phase include project plans, estimated costs, schedules, and procurement needs." 
const analysisofrequirements = "The Analysis Phase involves analyzing business requirements, documenting user requirements, identifying system functions and features, creating a detailed design specification, reviewing project feasibility, and developing a timeline. The team also assesses potential risks, creates a risk management plan, conducts cost analysis, and evaluates various technologies to choose the best fit for the project. Additionally, the team analyzes market trends, identifies competitors, and creates user interface designs to ensure user-friendliness."
const design = "The SDLC Design Phase is the third stage of the software development life cycle, encompassing architecture design, user interface design, and code development design. The design phase addresses all user requirements, system functions, and features identified in the analysis phase.  In addition, the team develops a database, data flow diagram, system security plan, and deployment plan to guarantee proper software development and project completion within time and budget constraints." 

const implementation = "The SDLC Implementation Phase involves creating the software, writing the code, developing a testing plan, and implementing a version control system. The team also creats documentation, user training plans, a bug-tracking system."

const testingIntegration = "The testing phase verifies the system's functionality and ensures it meets requirements. Teams create a test plan, test environment, and conduct security and performance testing for successful project completion."

const maintain = "Once the system is tested and verified, the maintenance phase begins by monitoring software performance, creating a maintenance plan, conducting post-implementation review, and ensuring proper management. The team should also prepare a backup plan, monitor performance, establish user feedback and change management systems, and perform security testing."
